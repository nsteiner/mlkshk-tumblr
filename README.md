tumblr-gif-catalog
=============

A tumblr theme for gif catalogs. 

Inspired by (but not modeled after) the most excellent [mlkshk](http://mlkshk.com/) site.
*Update*: mlkshk is alive and well, so go use it! But if you want your tumblr site to be a gif catalog, this simple theme remains at your disposal.

*Update No. 2*: Welp, mlkshk is going to shut down again, sounds like this time it's for real. Anyways, have this if you want.

4. paste the contents of the html file in this repo in there
5. click "Update Preview"

## Other thing to know

tumblr won't accept animated gifs over 1 MB, so size down, change to adaptive palate, etc to get the size down.
