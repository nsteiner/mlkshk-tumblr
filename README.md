tumblr theme: gif catalog
=============

A very simple tumblr theme. I use it to keep a catalog of gifs, but it can also be a general starting point for further customization.

## How to use

1. log into tumblr
2. click "Customize"
3. click "Edit HTML"
4. paste the contents of the html file in this repo in there
5. click "Update Preview"
6. click "Save"
7. customize to your liking

## Other thing to know

tumblr won't accept animated gifs over 1 MB, so size down, change to adaptive palate, etc to get the size down.
